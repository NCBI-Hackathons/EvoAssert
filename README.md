# ORTHOGRASP 
A tool to identify orthology information in several species of interest

This pipeline can be utilized to obtain orthologous sequences for a given set of genes by harnessing a orthology engine and retrieving sequence information from BioMart. By inputing a list of genes of interest, we can obtain an output fasta file with sequences from the different species of interest.
